# Fitness Ladder

This is a very simple JavaScript web app to keep track of which rung of the [Fitness Ladder](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html) you are on. The web page simply writes a cookie to keep track of which rung you last used. No other personal data is recorded.

If you need help with learning what the exercises are, check out the [Fitness Ladder exercise program](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html) page.
